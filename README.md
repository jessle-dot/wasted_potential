# wasted_potential
This is an interactive website for helping people who would like to use/volunteer/donate to food banks in London. The website can be viewed at: https://jessle-dot.github.io/wasted_potential/index.html

# Some pages of note
Food banks can be searched for by name at https://jessle-dot.github.io/wasted_potential/monday.html.

# Future work
I'd like to show all of the food banks on the interactive map, and add more functionality to the filters. I'd also like to store people's comments and be able to answer them. Finally I'd like to collaborate with the people who compile the original list of soup kitchens to keep this website up to date (and have some of their input too!).
